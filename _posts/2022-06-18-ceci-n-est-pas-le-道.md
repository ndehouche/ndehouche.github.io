This is the kind of post that I may look back on, a few years from now, with tender embarrassment at how naive it was, or not. In any case, I want to record this as the best of my theoretical understanding, as of the time of this writing.

My favorite translation of the term "Tao" is Richard Wilhelm's, via Carl Jung's Synchronicity: Tao=Meaning (in the conventional sense of the word). And as the saying goes the Tao that can be spoken of is not the Tao.

I have recently come to the slight yet important shift in belief that Meaning is the basic building block of everything, not matter, and not information. Digital Physics is a trap people with the right intuition but playing it self when it comes to expressing it got us into, as often happens.
I am saying that anything that exists is meaning (not *has* meaning, mind you). Consciousness is the only thing that experientially and provably exists without being meaning.

This is in perfect opposition to the conventional materialist perspective where things have no meaning (let alone *are* meaning), and consciousness is what endows them with it. 
An opposition that is so total that it ends up being indistinction, just a half black-half white circle is the same as half white-half black circle, but knowing that what you're looking at can be either adds a degree of freedom and makes a difference.

Also, this is all somehow related to a dream of me teaching a class shirtless, struggling to explain a concept (but wanting to get it out before taking a break), and being interrupted by grandfather, there to support me, who told me he felt tired and couldn't understand what I was trying to say, so I announced a break to the whole class.
