title: "Keeping Sane with New Forms of Money"

A cheap knockoff of a meme coin, made me more money than any other investment I made, and any work I did this year.

This is the power of meme logic, aka magic, aka real logic at the root of Western thought, as per [Peter Kingsley](https://peterkingsley.org/product/reality/). 

It is very humbling and disturbing. I don't want the world to be this way. I'd prefer things to make sense; capital to reward productivity.


One year ago, I considered a $1000 investment in Ethereum wildly speculative. Now I am knee-deep into Solidity programming. Two years before that it was Bitcoin that was speculative. Since then I have bought ChainLink, Doge, Shiba Inu, and now fbomb and other offshoots of offshoots, and seen these new forms of money gain legitimacy, each one quicker than the last. 
The old heuristics of no more than 10-15% of your assets in speculative investments (which mainly meant Bitcoin) need to be dynamically updated, as new forms of money grow in value and legitimacy. 

One rule I have adopted, in the midst of this craziness, is to only branch into a new, speculative form of money once the current form yields enough to cover my investment in the previous form. It is simpler to see with an example:
1. Invest x USD to buy y BTC.
2. Only invest in ETH if your BTC investment yields at least x USD and y BTC. 
3. Save those and invest z in ETH, where z=total capital - x USD - y BTC.
4. Repeat for new promising form of money, with z as a baseline.
